##Abstract:
We know that COVID-19 spreads very easily like any other flu and the number of positive cases are growing at a high exponential rate. 
If we do not take necessary measures and utilize all possible diagnostic tools, it would take us a significantly longer amount of time to combat this pandemic.

##Objective and Tech Stack:
Taking X-ray images of patients, I will be building a machine learning model that will analyze and detect 
if the patient is COVID Positive (i.e. the target value =1) patient or Not COVID Positive (i.e. the target value =0) patient.
